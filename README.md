METAL DETECTOR

 

Metal detectors work

 

Metal detectors work by transmitting an electromagnetic field from

 

the search coil into the ground. Any metal objects targets within the

 

electromagnetic field will become energised and retransmit an

 

electromagnetic field of their own. The detector’s search coil

 

receives the retransmitted field and alerts the user by producing a

 

target response.

 

We connect a single copper to the circuit output so that a magnetic field is formed inside. After giving +5 or +6 Volt energy to the circuit, our circuit will work. When the circuit worked, when we threw a metal object into the copper wire we connected, the buzzer would sound and our led would light up for warning.
